No Tao that may be Tao is the constant Tao;
No name that may be a name is the constant name.
By non-being you name the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
By being you name the mother of the ten thousand things.
Therefore, always free of desire you see the secret;
Always with desire you see its appearance.
These two
Are the same in origin yet different in name.
Their sameness may be called a mystery.
It is the mystery beyond mysteries,
The gate to myriad secrets.
