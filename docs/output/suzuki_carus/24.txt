One on tiptoe is not steady;
One astride makes no advance.
Seff-displayers are not enlightened,
Self-asserters lack distinction,
Self-approvers have no merit,
And self-seekers stunt their lives.

Before Reason this is like surfeit of food; it is like a wen on the body with which people are apt to be disgusted.

Therefore the man of reason will not indulge in it.
