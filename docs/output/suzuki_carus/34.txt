How all-pervading is the great Reason! It can be on the left and it can be on the right.

The ten thousand things depend upon it for their life, and it refuses them not. When its merit is accomplished it assumes not the name. Lovingly it nourishes the ten thousand things and plays not the lord. Ever desireless it can be classed with the small. The ten thousand things return home to it. It plays not the lord. It can be classed with the great.

Therefore

The holy man unto death does not make himself great and can thus accomplish his greatness.
