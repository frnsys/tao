Abandon your saintliness; put away your prudence; and the people will gain a hundredfold!

Abandon your benevolence; put away your justice; and the people will return to filial piety and paternal devotion.

Abandon smartness; give up greed; and thieves and robbers will no longer exist.

These are three things for which culture is insufficient. Therefore it is said:

"Hold fast to that which will endure,
Show thyself simple, preserve thee pure,
And lessen self with desires fewer."
