"Vast virtue's form
Follows Reason's norm.

"And Reason's nature
Is vague and eluding.

"How eluding and vague
All types including!
How vague and eluding,
All beings including!
How deep and how obscure.
It harbors the spirit pure,
Whose truth is ever sure,
Whose faith abides for aye
From of yore until to-day.

"Its name is never vanishing,
It heeds the good of everything."

Through what do I know that "it heeds the good of everything"? In this way, verily: Through IT.
