"The five colors [combined] the human eye will blind;
The five notes [in one sound] the human ear confound;
The five tastes [when they blend] the human mouth offend."

"Racing and hunting will human hearts turn mad,
Treasures high-prized make human conduct bad."

Therefore

The holy man attends to the inner and not to the outer. He abandons the latter and chooses the former.
