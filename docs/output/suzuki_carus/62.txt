The man of Reason is the ten thousand creatures' refuge, the good man's wealth, the bad man's stay.

With beautiful words one can sell. With honest conduct one can do still more with the people.

If a man be bad, why should he be thrown away? Therefore, an emperor was elected and three ministers appointed; but better than holding before one's face the jade table [of the ministry] and riding with four horses, is sitting still and propounding the eternal Reason.

Why do the ancients prize this Reason? Is it not, say, because when sought it is obtained and the sinner thereby can be saved? Therefore it is world-honored.
