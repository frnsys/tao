"Greatest perfection imperfect will be,
But its work ne'er waneth.
Greatest fulness is vacuity,
Its work unexhausted remaineth."

"Straightest lines resemble curves;
Greatest skill like a tyro serves;
Greatest eloquence stammers and swerves."

Motion conquers cold. Quietude conquers heat. Purity and clearness are the world's standard.
