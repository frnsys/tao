When the Master governs, the people
are hardly aware that he exists.
Next best is a leader who is loved.
Next, one who is feared.
The worst is one who is despised. If you don't trust the people,
you make them untrustworthy. The Master doesn't talk, he acts.
When his work is done,
the people say, "Amazing: we did it, all by ourselves!"
