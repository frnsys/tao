Throw away holiness and wisdom,
and people will be a hundred times happier.
Throw away morality and justice,
and people will do the right thing.
Throw away industry and profit,
and there won't be any thieves. If these three aren't enough,
just stay at the center of the circle
and let all things take their course.
