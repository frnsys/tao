If you realize that all things change,
there is nothing you will try to hold on to.
If you aren't afraid of dying,
there is nothing you can't achieve. Trying to control the future
is like trying to take the master carpenter's place.
When you handle the master carpenter's tools, chances are that you'll cut your hand.
