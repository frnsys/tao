A tao that can be spoken about
Is not the constant Tao;
A name that can be named
Is not the constant name.
Nonbeing names
The ten thousand things' beginning;
Being names
The ten thousand things' mother.
Therefore, constantly be desireless,
Whereby to observe its minutiae;
Constantly be desirous,
Whereby to observe where it ends.
The two issued from the same origin,
And, though different in name,
Refer to the same thing.
Deep and remote, doubly deep and remote,
Gate of multitudinous minutiae.
