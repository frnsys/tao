He who knows other men is discerning; he who knows himself is
intelligent. He who overcomes others is strong; he who overcomes
himself is mighty. He who is satisfied with his lot is rich; he who
goes on acting with energy has a (firm) will.

He who does not fail in the requirements of his position, continues
long; he who dies and yet does not perish, has longevity.
