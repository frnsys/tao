The Tao that is utterable
Is not the eternal Tao;
The name that is namable
Is not the eternal Name.
The Nothingness is the name of the beginning of heaven and earth;
The Being (substance) is the name of the mother of all things.
Hence one should gain an insight into the beginning of the Tao by constantly observing the Nothingness,
And should perceive the end of the Tao by constantly observing the Being.
These two things, the Nothingness and the Being, are of the same origin but different in name.
They are both so profound as to be a key to the door of myriad secrets.
