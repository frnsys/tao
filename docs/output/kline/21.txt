Great virtue follows the Way
And the Way alone.
How shadowy, how indistinct!
Within it is the form.
How shadowy, how indistinct!
Within it is the ‘thing’.
How dim, how dark!

Within, it can be tested.
From present to ancient times
Its name was never lost.
So we can investigate the origins of all.
How do I know the origins of all are that?
By means of this.
