Eliminate learning: and there’s no worry.
Between ‘yes’ and ‘no’, what’s the difference?
What separates ‘good’ and ‘bad’?
But one must respect what others respect.
The people are happy
As if at a marvellous feast,
Or going on a spring outing,
Only I am unmoved and silent,
Abandoned to disorder without limit.
Like a baby that’s not yet smiled,
Aimless, like one of the homeless.
The people have all they want,
It’s only me that’s in need,
My mind’s ignorant – so dull!
Yet the crowd are clear-minded,
It’s only me that’s muddled.
Yet the crowd are all-knowing,
Only from me it’s hidden.
Levelled flat like the ocean,
Like an endless wind blowing.
Everyone has a purpose.
It’s only me that’s raw and foolish.
I’m different from the others.
I like being fed by the Mother!
