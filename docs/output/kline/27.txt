Expert travelling leaves no track:
Expert speaking is free of faults.
Expert counting uses no beads.
Expert closing stays shut without locks.
Expert tying is firm without knots.
So the wise are expert in utilising people
And discarding no one,
Expert in utilising things
And discarding nothing.
This is called the application of knowledge.
So the wise are teachers the ignorant learn from,
And the ignorant are material for the wise.
Not to value the teacher,
Not to love the material,
Though it seems clever
Reveals confusion.
This is called the essential secret.
