One who possesses true virtue
Is like a new-born infant.
Poisonous insects won’t sting it.
Savage creatures won’t bite it.
Birds of prey won’t claw it.
Though its bones are weak,
And its muscles feeble,
Its grip is still strong.
Though it doesn’t know about sexual union
Its sexual parts are already active,
This is because it has perfect vitality.
It cries all day without becoming hoarse,
This is because it’s in perfect harmony.
To know this harmony is called the constant.
To know the constant is called enlightenment.
Fuelling the vital spirits is called disastrous.
Mind impelling the breath is called violence.
The creature that ignores what exists from of old
Is described as going against the Way.
What goes against the Way
Will come to a swift end.
