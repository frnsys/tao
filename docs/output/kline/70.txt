My words are easy to understand
And easy to put into practice,
Yet no one can understand them
Or put them into practice.
Words must have an origin
And actions must have a guide.
People ignorant of this
Fail to understand me.
Those who understand are few:
Those who ignore me are celebrated.
So the wise though meanly dressed,
Hide priceless jade on their person.
