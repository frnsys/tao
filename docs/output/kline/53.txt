If I had a little knowledge
I’d walk the great Way,
And only fear straying from it.
The great Way is broad,
But people like sidetracks.
The Court is immaculate
But the fields are full of weeds.
The barns are empty
But the rulers are finely dressed,
Swords by their sides,
Gorged with food and drink,
Owning too much wealth.
This is called glorious theft.
This is far away from the Way.
