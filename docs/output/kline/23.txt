To speak infrequently
Is natural.
So a strong wind won’t last all morning,
A downpour won’t last all day.
What causes these? Heaven and earth.
If even heaven and earth must rest,
How much more so human beings?
Therefore align yourself to the Way.
Aligned with the Way you are one with the Way.
Aligned with virtue you are one with virtue.
Aligned with the heavens you are one with the heavens.
The Way accepts this alignment gladly.
Virtue accepts this alignment gladly.
The heavens accept this alignment gladly.
When there is lack of faith
There is a lack of respect.
