One who understands others is clever.
One who understands the ‘self’ is enlightened.
One who conquers others is forceful.
One who conquers the ‘self’ is strong.
One who can be content is rich.
One who can act with purpose has will.
One who doesn’t lose place endures.
One who dies without loss has lived a life.
