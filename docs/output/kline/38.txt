The highest virtue doesn’t practise virtue
That’s why it is virtuous.
The lowest virtue is always ‘virtuous’
That’s why it has no virtue.
The highest virtue is inaction
But nothing is left undone.
The lowest virtue is action
But things are always left undone.
Benevolence is acting
But without ulterior motives.
Rectitude is acting
But with ulterior motives.
Those steeped in the rites act,
And when no one responds,
They roll up their sleeves
And resort to threats.
So when the Way was lost
There was ‘virtue’.
When virtue was lost
There was benevolence.
When benevolence was lost
There was rectitude.
When rectitude was lost
There were the rites.
The rites are only the semblance
Of loyalty and sincerity,
And a source of disorder.
The seer is a flowery decoration
Obscuring the Way,
And a source of foolishness.
So the wise live in the substance
And not in the semblance.
In the fruit
And not in the flower.
They take the one, and leave the other.
