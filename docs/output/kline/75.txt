The people are starving.
It’s because their rulers over-tax them
That the people are starving.
The people are hard to govern.
It’s because their rulers are quick to act
That people are hard to govern.
The people treat death lightly.
It’s because people over-value life
That they treat death lightly.
It’s because one sets no store by life,
That one is wiser than those who do.
