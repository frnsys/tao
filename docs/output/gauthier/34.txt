All-pervading is the Great Tao! It may be found on the left hand anion the right. All things depend on it for their production, which it gives to them, not one refusing obedience to it. When it gives to them, not one refusing obedience to it. When its work is accomplished, it does not claim the name of having done it. It clothes all things as with a garment, and makes no assumption of being their lord;-it may be named in the smallest things. All things return (to their root and disappear), and do not know that it is it which presides over their doing so;-it may be named in the greatest things. Hence the sage is able (in the same way) to accomplish his great achievements. It is through his not making himself great they the can accomplish them.
