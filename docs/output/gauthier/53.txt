If I were suddenly to become known, and (put into a position to) conduct(a government) according to the Great Tao, what I should be most afraid of would be a boastful display. The great Tao (or way) is very level and easy; but people love the by-ways. Their court(-yards and buildings) shall be well kept, but their fields shall be ill-cultivated, and their granaries very empty. They shall wear elegant and ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have superabundance of property and wealth;-such (princes) may be called robbers and boasters. This is contrary to the Tao surely!
