The sage has no invariable mind of his own; he makes the mind of the people his mind. To those who are good (to me), I am good; and to those who are not (to me), I am also good,-and thus (all) get to be good. To those who are sincere (with me), I am sincere; and to those who are not sincere (with me), I am also sincere;-and thus (all) get to be sincere.The sage has in the world an appearance of indecision, and keeps his minding a state of indifference to all. The people all keep their eyes and ears directed to him, and he deals with them all as his children.
