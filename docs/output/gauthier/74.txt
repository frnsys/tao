The people do not fear death; to what purpose is it to (try to) frighten them with death? If the people were always in awe of death, and I could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death, who would dare to do wrong? There is always One who presides over the infliction of death.He who would inflict death in the room of him who so presides over it maybe described as hewing wood instead of a great carpenter. Seldom is that who undertakes the hewing, instead of the great carpenter, does not cut his own hands!
