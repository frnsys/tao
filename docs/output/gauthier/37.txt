The tao in its regular course does nothing (for the sake of doing it), and so there is nothing which it does not do. If princes and kings were able to maintain it, all things would of themselves be transformed by them. If this transformation became to me an object of desire, I would express the desire by the nameless simplicity.

Simplicity without a name. Is free from all external aim. With no desire, at rest and still, All things go right as of their will.
