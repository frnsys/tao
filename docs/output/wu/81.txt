Sincere words are not sweet;
Sweet words are not sincere.
The good man is not argumentative;
The argumentative man is not good.
The wise man is not erudite;
The erudite man is not wise.
The sage does not hoard.
The more he does for others,
The more he has for himself.
The more he gives to others,
The more he gains for himself.
The way of Heaven is to benefit others, not to harm them.
The way of the sage is to act, but not to compete with others.
