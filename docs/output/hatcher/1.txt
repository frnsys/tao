A path fit to travel
Is not a general path
A name fit for calling
Is not a generic name
“Nothing” names the origin of heaven and earth
“Being” names the mother of the myriad beings
And so, always be dispassionate
In order to see the mysteries
Always be passionate
In order to see the objectives
These two mean the same (when) emerging
While diverging in significance
The sameness tells of their mystery
Mystery leading to greater mystery
(Is) the gateway to every mystery
