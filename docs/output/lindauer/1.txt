A tao that one can tao
Is not the entire tao
A name that one can name
Is not the entire name.

In the absence of names
Lies the origin of heavens and earth
The presence of names
Is mother to the 10000 things.

So viewing entireness without desire
One may see subtleties
Viewing entireness with desire
One may see boundaries.

That which is these both
Goes about as itself yet there are different names.
Categorizing them together there is insight
Very deep insight
The gateway to collective subtleties.
