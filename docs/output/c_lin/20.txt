Respect and insolence, - are they really different?
Beauty and ugliness, - are they really different?
A man feels compelled to detest that which the multitude detest.
The multitude seem to be busy and merry as though they were celebrating a religious festival or attending a spring picnic.
I alone remain quiet and indifferent.
I roam about in a wide expanse as though I could never find an anchorage.
I am simple and ignorant like a new-born babe.
I fell weary and desolate like a homeless solitaire.
The multitude seem to have plenty.
I alone seem to have an insufficiency.
The multitude appear wise.
I alone look foolish.
The multitude appear bright.
I alone look dull.
I am like one tossed about on the wide sea or blown about in a high gale.
The multitude appear useful.
I alone look worthless.
I am different from other men, because I alone esteem the attainment of Truth.
