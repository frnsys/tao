As soon as the world regards some thing as beautiful, forthwith also appears ugliness.
As soon as the world regards some deed as good, forthwith also appears evil.
Thus we have the alternation of existence and non-existence;
the succession of the difficult and the easy;
the comparison of the long and the short;
the contrast between the high and the low;
the variation of pitch notes;
the order of precedence and sequence.
The Sage is ever free from artifice, and practises the precept of silence.
He dose things without the desire for control.
He lives without the thought of private ownership.
He gives without the wish for return.
He achieves without claiming credit for himself.
Because he does not claim credit for himself, he is always given credit.
