That which cannot be seen is formless.
That which cannot be heard is noiseless.
That which cannot be touched is bodiless.
These three cannot be examined in detail for they really constitute one indivisible whole.
This indivisible whole (Truth) does not appear bright when viewed at the summit, or dark when viewed at the nadir.
It is imperceptible and indescribable.
It is always changing, and reverting to the state of Nothingness.
It is formless, shapeless, vague, and indefinite.
Pacing it, one cannot see its head; pursuing it, one cannot see its tail.
Abide by this primordial Truth, and the States of today can be ruled.
Know the primary conditions, and you know the principles of Truth.
