When one has attained the utmost humility and abided in the state of extreme quiescence, he can observe the cycle of changes in the simultaneous growth of all animate creation.
Things appear multitudinous and varied, but eventually they all return to the common root.
When they revert to the common root, there is quiescence.
The state of quiescence is called the fulfilment of destiny.
The fulfilment of destiny is called normalcy.
The knowledge of normalcy is called enlightenment.
The ignorance of normalcy causes haphazard action, and brings about calamities.
Knowing normalcy, a man becomes perspicacious.
Being perspicacious, he becomes altruistic, supreme, celestial, true, and everlasting.
Throughout his life nothing can do him harm.
