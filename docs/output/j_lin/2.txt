When all in the world recognize beauty as beauty, it is ugliness.
When they recognize good as good, it is not good.
Therefore,
being and non-being beget each other,
hard and easy complement each other,
long and short shape each other,
high and low rely on each other,
sound and voice harmonize with each other,
front and back follow each other.
Therefore, the Sage administers without action and instructs without words.
He lets all things rise without dominating them,
produces without attempting to possess,
acts without asserting,
achieves without taking credit.
And because he does not take credit, it will never leave him.
