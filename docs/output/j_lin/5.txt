Without kindness heaven and earth treat all things as straw dogs.
Without kindness the Sage treats the people as straw dogs.
The space between heaven and earth is a vacuum like a bellows,
Emptied, but inexhaustible.
The more it moves, the more it yields.
Too much talk often brings exhaustion.
Is it not better to keep to the middle path?
