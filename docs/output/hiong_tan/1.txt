Dao that can be expressed in words is not the absolute Dao.
The names that can be given are not the absolute names.
Non-being is before the dawn of time,
Being is when everything begins to emerge.
Therefore, maintaining a passive and receptive mode,
You can watch the secret of life;
Maintaining an active and attentive mode,
You can perceive the rhythm of life.
These two cognitive processes, though differing in names,
Are in the same continuum.
Both are known as the inscrutable Mystery,
Which is the greatest of all mysteries.
And it is through these perspectives that we can observe the marvellous phenomena of Nature.
