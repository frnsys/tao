If Tao can be described, then it is not general Tao.
If a name can be denned, then it is not a general name.
The invisible is the origin of the universe.
The visible is the mother of all things.
By constantly thinking the invisible, we understand the universe;
By constantly observing the visible, we can see how the natural laws work.
Thinking and observing are two different things.
Yet they serve the same goal: to theorize.
Theorizing and evolving these theories is the gate to marvels.
