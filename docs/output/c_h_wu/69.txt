THE strategists have a saying:
I dare not be a host, but rather a guest;
I dare not advance an inch, but rather retreat a foot.

This is called marching without moving,
Rolling up one's sleeves without baring one's arms,
Capturing the enemy without confronting him,
Holding a weapon that is invisible.

There is no greater calamity than to under-estimate
the strength of your enemy.
For to under-estimate the strength of your enemy is
to lose your treasure.

Therefore, when opposing troops meet in battle,
victory belongs to the grieving side.
