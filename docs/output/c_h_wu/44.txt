As for your name and your body, which is the dearer?
As for your body and your wealth, which is the
more to be prized?
As for gain and loss, which is the more painful?

Thus, an excessive love for anything will cost you dear
in the end.
The storing up of too much goods will entail a heavy
loss.

To know when you have enough is to be immune from
disgrace.
To know when to stop is to be preserved from perils.
Only thus can you endure long.
