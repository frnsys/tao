WHEN the world is in possession of the Tao,
The galloping horses are led to fertilize the fields
with their droppings.
When the world has become Taoless,
War horses breed themselves on the suburbs.

There is no calamity like not knowing what is enough.
There is no evil like covetousness.
Only he who knows what is enough will always have
enough.
