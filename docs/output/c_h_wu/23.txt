ONLY simple and quiet words will ripen of
themselves.
For a whirlwind does not last a whole morning,
Nor does a sudden shower last a whole day.
Who is their author? Heaven-and-Earth!
Even Heaven-and-Earth cannot make such violent things
last long;
How much truer is it of the rash endeavours of men?

Hence, he who cultivates the Tao is one with the Tao;
He who practices Virtue is one with Virtue;
And he who courts after Loss is one with Loss.

To be one with the Tao is to be a welcome accession
to the Tao;
To be one with Virtue is to be a welcome accession
to Virtue;
To be one with Loss is to be a welcome accession
to Loss.

Deficiency of faith on your part
Entails faithlessness on the part of others.
