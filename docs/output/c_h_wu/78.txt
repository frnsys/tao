NOTHING in the world is softer and weaker than
water;
But, for attacking the hard and strong, there is nothing
like it!

For nothing can take its place.
That the weak overcomes the strong, and the soft
overcomes the hard,
This is something known by all, but practised by none.

Therefore, the Sage says:
To receive the dirt of a country is to be the lord of
its soil-shrines.
To bear the calamities of a country is to be the prince of
the world.
Indeed, Truth sounds like its opposite!
