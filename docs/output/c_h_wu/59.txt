IN governing a people and in serving Heaven,
There is nothing like frugality.
To be frugal is to return before straying.
To return before straying is to have a double reserve
of virtue.
To have a double reserve of virtue is to overcome
everything.
To overcome everything is to reach an invisible height.
Only he who has reached an invisible height can have
a kingdom.
Only he who has got the Mother of a kingdom can
last long.
This is the way to be deep-rooted and firm-planted
in the Tao,
The secret of long life and lasting vision.
