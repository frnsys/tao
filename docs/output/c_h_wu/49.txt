THE Sage has no interests of his own,
But takes the interests of the people as his own.
He is kind to the kind;
He is also kind to the unkind:
For Virtue is kind.
He is faithful to the faithful;
He is also faithful to the unfaithful:
For Virtue is faithful.

In the midst of the world, the Sage is shy and
self-effacing.
For the sake of the world he keeps his heart in its
nebulous state.
All the people strain their ears and eyes:
The Sage only smiles like an amused infant.
