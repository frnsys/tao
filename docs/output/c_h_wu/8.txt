THE highest form of goodness is like water.
Water knows how to benefit all things without
striving with them.
It stays in places loathed by all men.
Therefore, it comes near the Tao.

In choosing your dwelling, know how to keep to
the ground.
In cultivating your mind, know how to dive in
the hidden deeps.
In dealing with others, know how to be gentle and kind.
In speaking, know how to keep your words.
In governing, know how to maintain order.
In transacting business, know how to be efficient.
In making a move, know how to choose the right
moment.

If you do not strive with others,
You will be free from blame.
