DOES anyone want to take the world and do what he
wants with it?
I do not see how he can succeed.

The world is a sacred vessel, which must not be
tampered with or grabbed after.
To tamper with it is to spoil it, and to grasp it is to
lose it.

In fact, for all things there is a time for going ahead, and
a time for following behind;
A time for slow-breathing and a time for fast-breathing;
A time to grow in strength and a time to decay;
A time to be up and a time to be down.

Therefore, the Sage avoids all extremes, excesses and
extravagances.
