WHAT is at rest is easy to hold.
What manifests no omens is easily forestalled.
What is fragile is easily shattered.
What is small is easily scattered.

Tackle things before they have appeared.
Cultivate peace and order before confusion and disorder
have set in.

A tree as big as a man's embrace springs from a tiny
sprout.
A tower nine stories high begins with a heap of earth.
A journey of a thousand leagues starts from where your
feet stand.

He who fusses over anything spoils it.
He who grasps anything loses it.
The Sage fusses over nothing and therefore spoils
nothing.
He grips at nothing and therefore loses nothing.

In handling affairs, people often spoil them just
at the point of success.
With heedfulness in the beginning and patience
at the end, nothing will be spoiled.

Therefore, the Sage desires to be desireless,
Sets no value on rare goods,
Learns to unlearn his learning,
And induces the masses to return from where
they have overpassed.
He only helps all creatures to find their own nature,
But does not venture to lead them by the nose.
