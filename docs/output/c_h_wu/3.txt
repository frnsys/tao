BY not exalting the talented you will cause the people
to cease from rivalry and contention.
By not prizing goods hard to get, you will cause the
people to cease from robbing and stealing.
By not displaying what is desirable, you will cause the
people's hearts to remain undisturbed.

Therefore, the Sage's way of governing begins by

Emptying the heart of desires,
Filling the belly with food,
Weakening the ambitions,
Toughening the bones.


In this way he will cause the people to remain without
knowledge and without desire, and prevent the
knowing ones from any ado.
Practice Non-Ado, and everything will be in order.
