ONE on tip-toe cannot stand.
One astride cannot walk.
One who displays himself does not shine.
One who justifies himself has no glory.
One who boasts of his own ability has no merit.
One who parades his own success will not endure.
In Tao these things are called "unwanted food and
extraneous growths,"
Which are loathed by all things.
Hence, a man of Tao does not set his heart upon them.
