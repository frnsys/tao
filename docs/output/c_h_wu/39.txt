FROM of old there are not lacking things that have
attained Oneness.
The sky attained Oneness and became clear;
The earth attained Oneness and became calm;
The spirits attained Oneness and became charged with
mystical powers;
The fountains attained Oneness and became full;
The ten thousand creatures attained Oneness and
became reproductive;
Barons and princes attained Oneness and became
sovereign rulers of the world.
All of them are what they are by virtue of Oneness.

If the sky were not clear, it would be likely to fall to
pieces;
If the earth were not calm, it would be likely to burst
into bits;
If the spirits were not charged with mystical powers,
they would be likely to cease from being;
If the fountains were not full, they would be likely to
dry up;
If the ten thousand creatures were not reproductive, they
would be likely to come to extinction;
If the barons and princes were not the sovereign rulers,
they would be likely to stumble and fall.

Truly, humility is the root from which greatness springs,
And the high must be built upon the foundation of the
low.

That is why barons and princes style themselves
"The Helpless One," "The Little One," and
"The Worthless One."
