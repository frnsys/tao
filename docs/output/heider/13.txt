If you measure success in terms of praise and criticism, your anxiety will be endless.
Having a good reputation or becoming well-known for your work can be a hindrance to your further development.
Fame is as burdensome as caring for yourself properly.
What is the problem with praise and criticism?
If the group applauds one thing you do, and then you feel good, you will worry if they do not applaud as loudly the next time. If they are critical, if they argue or complain, you will feel hurt. Either way, you are anxious and dependent.
How can a good reputation be a hindrance?
A good reputation naturally arises from doing good work. But if you try to cherish your reputation, if you try to preserve it, you lose the freedom and honesty necessary for further development.
How is fame like caring for yourself?
In order to do good work, you must take good care of yourself. You must value yourself and allow others to value you also. But if you make too much of yourself, you will become egocentric. Egocentricity injures both self and work.
If you can live with the fruits of success and care for yourself properly, you will be able to foster success in other people.
