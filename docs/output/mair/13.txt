"Being favored is so disgraceful that it startles,
Being honored is an affliction as great as one's body."
What is the meaning of "Being favored is so disgraceful that it startles"?
Favor is debasing;
To find it is startling,
To lose it is startling.
This is the meaning of "Being favored is so disgraceful that it startles."
What is the meaning of "Being honored is an affliction as great as one's body"?
The reason I suffer great afflictions is because I have a body;
If I had no body, what affliction could I suffer?
Therefore,
When a man puts more emphasis on caring for his body than on caring for all under heaven,
then all under heaven can be entrusted to him.
When a man is sparing of his body in caring for all under heaven,
then all under heaven can be delivered to him.
