The Way gives birth to them and integrity nurtures them.
Matter forms them and function completes them.
For this reason,
The myriad creatures respect the Way and esteem integrity.
Respect for the Way and esteem for integrity are by no means conferred upon them but always occur naturally.
The Way
gives birth to them,
nurtures them,
rears them,
follows them,
shelters them,
toughens them,
sustains them,
protects them.
It
gives birth but does not possess,
acts but does not presume,
rears but does not control.
This is what is called "mysterious integrity."
