The Way is eternally nameless.
Though the unhewn log is small,
No one in the world dares subjugate it.
If feudal lords and kings could maintain it,
The myriad creatures would submit of themselves.
Heaven and earth unite to suffuse sweet dew.
Without commanding the people,
equality will naturally ensue.
As soon as one begins to divide things up, there are names;
Once there are names, one should also know when to stop;
Knowing when to stop, one thereby avoids peril.
In metaphorical terms,
The relationship of all under heaven to the Way is like that of valley streams to the river and sea.
