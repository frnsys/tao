The ancients who practiced the Way did not enlighten the people with it;
They used it, rather, to stupefy them.
The people are hard to rule because they have too much knowledge.
Therefore,
Ruling a state through knowledge is to rob the state;
Ruling a state through ignorance brings integrity to the state.
One who is always mindful of these two types grasps a paradigm;
Mindfulness of this paradigm is called "mysterious integrity."
Deep and distant is this mysterious integrity!
It runs counter to things until it reaches the great confluence.
