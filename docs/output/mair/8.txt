The highest good is like water;
Water is good at benefiting the myriad creatures
but also struggles to occupy the place loathed by the masses.
Therefore,
It is near to the Way.
The quality of an abode is in its location,
The quality of the heart is in its depths,
The quality of giving lies in trust,
The quality of correct governance lies in orderly rule,
The quality of an enterprise depends on ability,
The quality of movement depends on timing.
Now,
It is precisely because one does not compete that there is no blame.
