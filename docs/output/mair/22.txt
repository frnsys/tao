If it
Is bent, it will be preserved intact;
Is crooked, it will be straightened;
Is sunken, it will be filled;
Is worn-out, it will be renewed;
Has little, it will gain;
Has much, it will be confused.
For these reasons,
The sage holds on to unity and serves as the shepherd of all under heaven.
He is not self-absorbed, therefore he shines forth;
He is not self-revealing, therefore he is distinguished;
He is not self-assertive, therefore he has merit;
He does not praise himself, therefore he is long-lasting.
Now,
Simply because he does not compete,
No one can compete with him.
The old saying about the bent being preserved intact is indeed close to the mark!
Truly, he shall be returned intact.
