One who assists the ruler of men with the Way
does not use force of arms against all under heaven;
Such a course is likely to boomerang.
Where armies have been stationed, briars and brambles will grow.
A good general fulfills his purpose
and that is all.
He does not use force to seize for himself.
He fulfills his purpose, but is not proud;
He fulfills his purpose, but is not boastful;
He fulfills his purpose, but does not brag;
He fulfills his purpose only because he has no other choice.
This is called "fulfilling one's purpose without using force."
If something grows old while still in its prime,
This is called "not being in accord with the Way."
Not being in accord with the Way leads to an early demise.
