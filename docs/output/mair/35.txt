Hold fast to the great image and all under heaven will come;
They will come but not be harmed, rest in safety and peace;
Music and fine food will make the passerby halt.
Therefore,
When the Way is expressed verbally,
We say such things as
"how bland and tasteless it is!"
"We look for it, but there is not enough to be seen."
"We listen for it, but there is not enough to be heard."
Yet, when put to use, it is inexhaustible!
