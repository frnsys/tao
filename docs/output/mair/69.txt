The strategists have a saying:
"I dare not be host, but would rather be guest;
I advance not an inch, but instead retreat a foot."
This is called
Marching without ranks,
Bearing nonexistent arms,
Flourishing nonexistent weapons,
Driving back nonexistent enemies.
There is no greater misfortune than not having a worthy foe;
Once I believe there are no worthy foes, I have well-nigh forfeited my treasures.
Therefore,
When opposing forces are evenly matched,
The one who is saddened will be victorious.
