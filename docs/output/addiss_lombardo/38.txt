High Te? No Te! That's what Te is. Low Te doesn't lack Te; That's what Te is not.
Those highest in Te take no action And don't need to act. Tose lowest in Te take action And do need to act.
Those highest in benevolence take action But don't need to act. Those highest in righteousness take action And do need to act. Those highest in propriety take action And if people don't reciprocate Roll up their sleeves and throw them out.
Therefore Lose Tao And Te follows. Lose Te and benevolence follows. Lose benevolence And righteousness follows. Lose righteousness and propriety follows.
Propriety dilutes loyalty and sincerity: Confusion begins. Foreknowledge glorifies the Tao: Stupidity sets in.
And so the ideal person dwells In substance, not dilution, In reality, not glory, Accepts one, rejects the other.
