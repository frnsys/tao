Good travelers leave no tracks. Good words leave no trace. Good counting needs no markers.
Good doors have no bolts Yet cannot be forced. Good knots have no rope But cannot be untied.
In this way the Sage Always helps people And rejects none, Always helps all beings, And rejects none. This is called practicing brightness.
Therefore the good person is the bad person's teachers, And the bad person Is the good person's resource.
Not to value the teacher, Not to love the resource, Causes great confusion even for the intelligent. This is called the vital secret.
